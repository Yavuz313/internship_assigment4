# City Navigation Simulator

## Overview

The City Navigation Simulator project allows users to simulate navigation scenarios within a city environment. It provides tools to visualize city grids, evaluate navigation performance, and interact with simulated navigation inputs.

## Features

- **Visualization**: View the city grid representation using matplotlib.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the efficiency and effectiveness of navigation simulations.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Simulate navigation paths based on user-defined inputs.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library for GUI
- Matplotlib library for data visualization

### Installing Dependencies

Install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Installation

To set up the project:

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
3. Open and run the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the simulator:

1. Open the `.ipynb` file to initialize the simulator.
2. Click on the "Visualize City Grid" button to display the city grid visualization.
3. Use the "Evaluate Performance" button to analyze navigation performance.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots demonstrating the simulator in action (if applicable).
